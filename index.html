    <p>Motivation and drive are often seen as positive characteristics. However, the very same traits that help a person move up in society can also lead to him/her never being satisfied with what they have achieved. Unfortunately, this can turn a good person into a greedy one. Macbeth’s greedy actions in Shakespeare's Macbeth demonstrate that excessive ambition can lead to one’s own downfall.

By act 3 of the play, Macbeth has already become the king and would be considered successful by most standards. Instead of enjoying his newfound success, Macbeth focuses on trying to keep his power for as long as possible. For example in response to being told that Banquo’s children would become king (and therefore replace him), he calls two murderers to the castle. He tells the murders “Fleance, his son, that keeps him company, / who's absence is no less material to me / then his father's, must embrace the fate / Of that dark hour“ (III, ii,154-157). Macbeth sends out the murderers to kill Banquo and Fleance because he was not satisfied just by being king. Later, when Macbeth learns that “Fleance is ‘scaped,” Macbeth becomes extremely paranoid (III, iv, 22). In other words, Macbeth’s needlessly ambitious actions negatively impacted himself.

Later in the play, Macbeth finds out that Macduff has fled to England. In an act of passion, Macbeth announces ‘The castle of Macduff I will surprise, / His wife, his babes” (IV, i, 171-173). There was no immediate need to kill Macduff's entire family so Macbeth’s actions were purely due to his over-passionate nature. This backfires on Macbeth because, upon hearing the news, Macduff decides to “Dispute it like a man” and kill Macbeth (IV, iii, 259). Macbeth's extreme desire for revenge and justice causes his life to be put in danger.

Macbeth's greedy actions and their consequences demonstrate that too much passion and drive often ends up harming one’s self. Macbeth shows readers the importance of enjoying what he/she has in the present instead of constantly chasing their next goal. Ultimately, too much of any positive trait can have a negative impact. Macbeth teaches its readers to reflect on their own actions and evaluate whether they have an overpowering trait that needs to be dialed back. Balancing out their traits will help readers avoid self sabotage by preventing them from obsessing over one thing and making poor decisions as a result.
